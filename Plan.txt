TO-DO:
Have a wee thought about structure of tasks/groups/users for future use, feels like something missing.
Create enough core API methods to be able to use entire system.
Flesh out the baseline web pages, no task logic just yet.
Create the front end API calling test, make sure we are getting data.
Start building the task tree/list.
Get everything working in a docker instance. v

Please for the love of god change the testing server to the docker SQL, not local MRMONEYBOX (in appsettings.json)
